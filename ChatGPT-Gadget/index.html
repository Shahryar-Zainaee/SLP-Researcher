  <title>ChatGPT Client — GitHub Pages Friendly (HTML Only)</title>
  <!--
  ================================================================
  PURPOSE
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Single‑file HTML chat UI for GitHub Pages (or any static host) that connects to your own backend which calls the OpenAI API.

  ✅ What you need
    1) A backend endpoint (e.g., https://your-app.onrender.com/api/chat) that accepts POST { message: string } and returns { reply: string }.
    2) CORS enabled for your GitHub Pages origin.

  🔐 Security note
    Never include your OpenAI API key here — keep it on the backend.
